# Product Guidelines - SaveTheScent

## Visual Identity
- **Aesthetic:** Minimalist & Ethereal with a "Wow Factor." The design should feel clean and spacious but contain unexpected, high-end interactive elements that surprise the user.
- **Color Palette:** Monochrome & Moody. Primary use of black, off-white, and deep charcoal.
- **Textures:** Heavy use of purposeful artistic elements like grainy gradients, noise filters, and "misty" overlays to evoke the invisible nature of scent.
- **Typography:** Sophisticated Serif (for headlines) paired with Clean Sans (for body/utility).
    - *Example Pairing:* Editorial New (Serif) + Geist (Sans).

## Motion & Interaction
- **Primary Motion:** Fluid & Smooth. Animations should feel like they are "wafting" or drifting, mirroring the movement of fragrance in the air.
- **Scroll Behavior:** Advanced scrollytelling with gentle parallax and fade reveals.
- **The "Wow Factor":** High-performance video masks, grainy gradient transitions between sections, and immersive shared-element transitions for the Scent Cards.

## Tone & Voice
- **Persona:** The Atmosphere Architect.
- **Tone:** Sophisticated, evocative, and professional. The writing should be concise and poetic, focusing on feelings and memories rather than technical specs.
- **Brand Messaging:** Emphasize the "invisible layer" and the "science of memory."
