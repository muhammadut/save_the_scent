# Initial Concept

I want to build a awwards style high design studio creative website for a scene business called codename: SaveTheScent. The Business:
You rent luxury scent diffuser devices for weddings and events. You've curated a collection of signature fragrances — each with an evocative name tied to a place and mood (like New York Mystify).
How It Works:

Client chooses a scent (or scents) from your collection
You arrive before the event, place the nebulizer devices strategically throughout the space
You activate them and leave before guests arrive
The space is transformed — guests experience the fragrance without ever seeing the source
You return after the event to collect the devices

What You're Really Selling:
Not diffusers. Not even fragrance. You're selling the invisible layer that makes an event feel elevated and memorable — the detail no one sees but everyone feels. The website should feel like a really high end design studio built it and the wesbite should feel like site of the year on awwards with advance scrolling animation, the way information is displayed, the art-style, probably in next js you can decide the other frameworks
